Welcome to my portfolio, I'm a junior Unity developer, graduated from Epitech school
(European Institute of technology).
My main assets are programming, project design and english language.
I've been working on several IT projects : VR/AR apps, Windows software, mobile apps (Android native), Video games (Unity3D, C++ OpenGL, SDL, etc.).
