<p align="justify">
    Welcome to my portfolio, I'm a junior Unity developer, graduated from Epitech school
    (European Institute of technology).
    My main assets are programming, project design and english language.
    I've been working on several IT projects: VR/AR apps, Windows software, mobile apps (Android native), Video games (Unity3D, C++ OpenGL, SDL, etc.).
    My school curriculum also included various modules to expand my knowledges on other subject such as computer law or marketing.
    About my personality, people describe me as someone motived, a hard worker with a constant rigor.
